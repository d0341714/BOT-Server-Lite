     This file the definitions and declarations of constants, structures, and
     functions used in the thpool.c file.

  Abstract:

     BeDIS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual descriptions of
     their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon is an inexpensive,
     Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and location description
     of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and
     Information System) and stored locally during deployment and maintenance
     times. Once initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and
     location description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
     area.

/*
  thpool_init

     Initializes a threadpool. This function will not return untill all
     threads have initialized successfully.

  Parameters:

     num_threads - The number of threads to be created in the threadpool.

  Return Value:

     Created threadpool on success, NULL on error.

 */

/*
  thpool_add_work

     Takes an action and its argument and adds it to the threadpool's job queue.
     If you want to add to work a function with more than one arguments then
     a way to implement this is by passing a pointer to a structure.

     NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument
             to not get warnings.

  Parameters:

     threadpool - threadpool to which the work will be added
     function_p - The pointer point to the function to be added as work.
     arg_p      - The pointer point to the argument use for function_p.
     priority   - This priority nice of this work.

      @example

          void print_num(int num){
             printf("%d\n", num);
          }

          int main() {
             ..
             int a = 10;
             thpool_add_work(thpool, (void*)print_num, (void*)a);
             ..
          }

  Return_Value:

     0 on successs, -1 otherwise.

int thpool_add_work(Threadpool threadpool, void (*function_p)(void *),

/*
  thpool_destroy

     This will wait for the currently active threads to finish and then 'kill'
     the whole threadpool to free up memory.

  Parameters:

     thpool - The threadpool to be destroyed.

       @example
       int main() {
          threadpool thpool1 = thpool_init(2);
          threadpool thpool2 = thpool_init(2);
          ..
          thpool_destroy(thpool1);
          ..
          return 0;
       }

  Return_value:

     None

 */

/*
  thpool_num_threads_working

     Working threads are the threads that are performing work (not idle).

  Parameters:

     thpool - The threadpool that we want to know the number of working threads.

       @example
       int main() {
          threadpool thpool1 = thpool_init(2);
          threadpool thpool2 = thpool_init(2);
          ..
          printf("Working threads: %d\n", thpool_num_threads_working(thpool1));
          ..
          return 0;
       }

  Return_Value:

     The number of threads is working currently.
