     This file contains programs to transmit and receive data to and from
     gateways through Wi-Fi network, and programs executed by network setup and
     initialization, beacon health monitor and comminication unit.

  Abstract:

     BeDIS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual descriptions of
     their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon is an inexpensive,
     Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and location description
     of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and
     Information System) and stored locally during deployment and maintenance
     times. Once initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and
     location description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
     area.
